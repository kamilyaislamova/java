some examples of my coding in Java

there are: 
1) scanner: analogue of the scanner class based on the reader class

2) expression: parsing expressions using the recursive descent method (expression parser). the program can also handle errors in parsing and evaluating expressions. the Generic directory presents calculations in various types of the abstract class Number

3) queue: in this directory there is an abstract class Queue, classes LinkedQueue and ArrayQueue implements Queue. other projects show the use of static class fields and static methods

4) search: this directory contains two binary searches: in the first project, recursive and iterative options, in the second, the closest element to a given one is found. both projects also describe why this code works

5) markup: a set of classes for text markup. classes can generate Markdown markup.

6) wsppSortedFirst: the class counts words in the text and displays them in lexicographical order, and also indicates the first occurrence in each line
